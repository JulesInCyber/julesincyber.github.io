# >> Hello World
I'm Jules, a systems-administrator based in Germany, building up my skills and knowledge
to transition deeper into cybersecurity.

I'm just getting started on my journey, and this page serves both a learning log and a place 
to share what I am working on -- especially as I tackle CTF challenges and hands-on labs.

Currently I am preparing for the **Blue Team Level 1** certification, which will mark my first
formal step into the field.

Over time, I plan to use this space to:
- Share write-ups of CTFs and labs I complete
- Track my progress through learning paths and certifications
- Explore and document tools and techniques

Whether you're on a similar path or just curious about my journey -- WELCOME!
