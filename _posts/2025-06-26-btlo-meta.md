## Scenario
The attached images were posted by a criminal on the run, with the caption "I'm roaming free. You will never catch me".
We believe you can assist us in proving him wrong. 

## Obtaining the files
We start by downloading the `zip`-file and moving it to a dedicated directory for our
investigations.
We can also use `mv` to rename the file, to get a more memorable filename.
After moving the file we use `7z x Meta.zip` to unzip the file and receive two image files.

## Exploring the metadata
We will be using `exiftool` in combination with `grep` to answer the first three questions,
using `grep -i` for every search pattern to ignore the case of our wanted pattern.

We start by extracting the camera model using `exiftool upload* | grep -i camera`

Next we use `exiftool upload* | grep -i time` to find all entries that include the pattern
"time".
The timestamp we want is listed as "Date/Time Original"

*Extracting the date and time of the image creation*

Last but not leas we use`exiftool upload* | grep - comment` to find the comment hidden in the
metadata.

## Reverse Image Search
To find the location where the images were taken we will be using Google's reverse image search.
After looking at both images we will be using `uploaded_2.png` as this has more color and
detail compared to `uploaded_1.JPG`.

The results include an article of the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/china/china-daily/basantapur-palace-restoration-nepal-b2176321.html)
That points us towards "The palace complex in the middle of Durbar Square".
We can then go to Google Maps and search for "Durbar Square" and verify the City of
REDACTED using Street View.
